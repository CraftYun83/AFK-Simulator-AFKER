web based mc client to afk in afk simulator

don't think its bannable, cus its just joining a house and then letting it sit there. 

I just wanted a way to not have my minecraft client open (which uses a lot of resources) while being able to interact with others and keep track of my xp earned.

Uses mineflayer mainly and a lot of other libraries made by prismarine.

Just run main.js, login using microsoft, then open the index.html file. If you want to see the environment around you, u can go to localhost:3007. I couldn't be bothered to incorporate that in the main index.html
